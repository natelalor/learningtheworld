## Summary
I have fallen in love with learning.

Whether it be American politics, software development, website design, accounting, international history, cooking, or finance, I have fallen into the rabbit hole of learning. I am exploring the world, and this website provides a chance for you all to join me. I want to show a bit more about who I am, whether it be personal or professional, and how I am navigating through this world.

A career does not define who you are. While I am extremely excited to enter the "cyber world," I know there is much more to me than my love of fields such as cyber security or software development. This website will show you more about who I am and what my interests are.
